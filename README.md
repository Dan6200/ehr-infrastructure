# Lean EHR Monorepo

## Overview

Welcome to the Lean EHR Monorepo, a comprehensive and scalable Electronic Health Record (EHR) system designed with a focus on modularity, security, and performance. This repository houses various interconnected modules that collectively form a modern healthcare management solution.

The project leverages a robust technology stack, primarily built with Next.js, Firebase, and Google Cloud Platform services, ensuring a secure, efficient, and maintainable application ecosystem.

## Modules

This monorepo is structured to organize different parts of the Lean EHR system into distinct, manageable packages. Each module is designed to operate independently while contributing to the overall system's functionality.

### Assisted Living Module

The `assisted-living` module is a core component of the Lean EHR system, specifically tailored for managing operations within assisted living facilities. It focuses on resident management, secure data handling, financial tracking, clinical analytics, and robust deployment pipelines.

For detailed information on its features, local development setup, data seeding, and deployment procedures, please refer to its dedicated documentation:
